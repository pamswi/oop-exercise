# OOP Exercise

test build

This repository is the starting point for an exercise in python OOP.  

The book.py file contains a blank slate class definition for you to fill in, as well as a comment describing the requirements.  

The test_book.py file contains unit tests for the search() and valid_isbn() methods, to validate your solutions to those requirements - feel free to add any additional test cases as you see fit.
